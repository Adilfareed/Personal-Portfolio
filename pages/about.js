            I graduated from FUUAST in 2024. I have a strong interest in coding and enjoy the challenge of tackling complex issues. I live in Karachi, Pakistan, where I am inspired by the thriving tech scene and am enthusiastic about the career options it has to offer. I'm excited to advance my knowledge and expertise in web development, and I look forward to making a contribution to the rapidly changing world of technology.
